Project Name: SmartHandUtil
Event Name: HackED Beta 2022
Team Name: Dynamic-Dev

This project aims to address a major problem faced by many users with severe or permanent disability in their arms / hands which hinders their ability to operate a computer using a keyboard & mouse. It'll help them to type their thoughts on the screen without using a keyboard & perform some basic functions like opening of files etc., with minimal touch of mouse and some additional features.

This project is in its early stages, and we wanted to see how well our concept could take shape. The original plan was to use a unique code (QR/ barcode, etc.) that would be stuck on the user's glove to perform various actions, but to get started, we used a colored marker to help the user air draw and some other functionalities to operate the computer with ease.

More changes and updates are on the way, which will be integrated with this project to assist in addressing computer operating issues for disabled people.
